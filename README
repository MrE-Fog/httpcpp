Disclaimer: 

I am by no means a C++ expert, but I try my best to write a simple and 
easy-to-understand code for the greatest benefit of mankind (sounds a little 
too big now!). What I am trying to say is if you find bugs (or believed to
be ones) or have suggestion, please feel free to communicate to me by creating 
issues in GitHub. Of course, pull requests are warmly welcome.
